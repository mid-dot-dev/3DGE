I have written this project to familiarize myself with the workings of 
OpenGL 4.x. The code is available free to use and distribute, external 
components of my code also conform this copyright. The project is available
as a Microsoft Visual Studios 2012 solution.

Aim: 
Optimized water surface simulation.

Method: 
LoD: Dynamic Tessellation with OpenGl 4.x
Model: Gerstner Wave Model

Procedure:
Setup: This project's application environment is heavily basses on the
application class set-up by the example code found in 
OpenGL Super Bible (Sixth Edition). 
Given time constraints, I did not wish to waste anytime setting up the Win32 
code as I have done for DirectX projects before. The application class is a 
wrapper using GLFW, for more information please refer to the Super Bible website. 

I have separated the class into a header and cpp file for better ease of use. 
Added an assert definition that also outputs a string for easier debugging. 
Added Output debug stings for environment verification in debug mode. Removed 
unnecessary pre-compiler configs. I am also going to be using their shader compiler
and math library to expedite my process.

All the core code is packed into my 3D Graphic Engine library a.k.a 3DGE or EDGE

Conclusions:
